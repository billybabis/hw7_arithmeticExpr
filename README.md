# hw7_arithmeticExpr

This is a simple easy-to-understand Java program to demonstrate my basic Object-Oriented Design proficiency. 
This a homework problem from a 2016 Object-Oriented Design course I enjoyed at Boston College.

Run the HW7Test file to see an Arithmetic Expression course accept and compute different operators and operands.
The program is intentionally basic so the Object-Oriented Design patterns can be highlighted.
